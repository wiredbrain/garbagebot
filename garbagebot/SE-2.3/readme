Package

   SE-2.3.zip


Contains

   SEL.PY          (Python source)
   SE.PY           (Python source)
   FORMEX.py       (Python source. Experimental derivation expanding arithmetic formulas interactively.)
   SE-DOC.HTM      (Manual)
   pkg-info
   readme          (This file)       
   SE-DOC-TEST.PY  (Testing loop cycling through the manual interactively)
   htm2iso.se      (A sample definition file, translating HTM ampersand escapes to bytes)



To get started

   Open the HTM manual and a Python IDLE window. 

   >>> execfile ('(your path)/se-demo.py')
   >>> run_demo ()

   You see this prompt:

   Number (e.g. 2.3.1.), N(ext) or Q(uit)? >

   To jump to a specific paragraph, enter its number:

   Number (e.g. 2.3.1.), N(ext) or Q(uit)? > 2.3.2.

   run_demo () will run those of the manual's examples that can be demoed in this manner,
   actually running the example and comparing the result it with the result in the manual.
   Some examples don't check out if the objective is to clarify a likely misconception.

Development History


Version 1       SR.EXE - (Search and Replace) MS-DOS-command-line program for batch processing. 

   1991  V1.x   No regular expressions.



Version 2       SEL.py, SE.py - (Stream Editor) Object-oriented functional transcript with regular expressions added.  

   2006  V2.1b  Released July 13, 2006
                
         V2.2b  Released August 8 2006

                A few minor fixes

         V2.3   Released October 13 2006

                Method do_file_name () has file-type output missing.
                Fixed: 9/25/2006 
 
                SEL.py line 352. OSError deleted: Pass by all exceptions. If an input 
                string contains a null byte, os.stat () raises a ValueError. All os.stat () 
                errors can be passed. No need to list them.
                Fixed: 10/1/2006

                The target stream being open ended the binary search may overshoot by several 
                places in the sorted target list. Backtstepping one place was statistically 
                correct most of the time but methodically incorrect and lead to occasional 
                missed replacements. 
                Fixed: 10/11/2006
                File objects seem to get their file pointers screwed up. Flushing seemed to be 
                the remedy, but writes still failed following an open-ended read. The following 
                (weird) fix solved the problem: f.seek (f.tell ()).
                Fixed: 10/2/2006

                Replace the term 'chain' with the more suggestive term 'cascade' for 
                sequential translations.
                Fixed: 10/13/2006

Planned Enhancements

Version 3       SEL.py, SE.py

   2007 V3.x    Will expand numbered target place holders as returned by _sre.SRE_Match objects'
                group (number) method for parenthesized regex substrings. 
                   The target place holder is the equal sign. If a number follows, it will identify 
                the regex parenthsized group, like this: '=3'

                >>> Rearrange = SE.SE ('"~([A-Z][a-z]*)\s+([A-Z]).*?([A-Z][a-z]*)~=Name: =3, First Name: =1"')
                >>> Rearrange ('Mathew M. Milligram')
                Name: Milligram, First Name: Mathew
